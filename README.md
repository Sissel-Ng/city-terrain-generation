This repo is made solely because of my love on planning metro lines, and the unsatisfaction on being only able to create on map in real life or in Minecraft (which is not a good imitation). 

On my planning, this repo should be able to create a good looking map that are realistic enough for such planning, given a seed.

Currently it is typed in Python, but later I may change to other programming language.
